# incomp_phase_loss

This repository the code of the implementation of the Iterative See-Saw (ISS) algorithm for maximizing the normalized Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) in the simultaneous estimation of phase and loss.

The data generated by this code supports the results presented in the paper: [M. E. O. Bezerra, F. Albarelli, R. Demkowicz-Dobrzanski, Simultaneous optical phase and loss estimation revisited:  measurement and probe incompatibility](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02893)
